ZeFunge quirks
'k' completely ignores ' ', ';', '"', 'k', and non-instructions (unprintables)
'k' resets IP to prior position BEFORE each iteration
'{' sets the new storage offset to 'position + delta', not necessary the next position to be executed
'y' counts by item, not by cell, when searching through its own output
no negative coordinates
world size remains unchanged while running, and always reasonably finite
